            <p class="topic1-text"> The Aes Sedai (Old Tongue: Servant of All) are women who can channel the One Power, and have been trained in the White Tower of Tar Valon. They have passed the tests for earning both the ring and the shawl and are bound by the Three Oaths. They are the only organization of female channelers in the Westlands (and until recently, they believed themselves to be the only legitimate channeling organization in the known world), giving them a vast amount of power and influence over the nations of the world, providing advisors to kings and queens.
            Each Aes Sedai belongs to one of the seven Ajahs, with the exception of their leader, the Amyrlin Seat, who is "of all Ajahs and none."</p>

            <p class="topic1-text"> It can be seen as a source, quite literally, of energy capable of manipulating the universe, which prolongs the lives of its users by a factor of ten or even more, depending on individual strength. It is never used up by someone channeling it, only woven into a purpose temporarily. Each half of the One Power can be used only by people of the associated sex. The two halves are direct opposites, yet both complement each other, by turning the Wheel of Time through both cooperation and opposition. The essential differences in the nature of the two halves of the Power mean that a woman cannot teach a man to channel, and vice versa.</p>

            <h2 class="topic1-title">Power Ranking</h2>
            <p class="topic1-text pretable"> According to The Wheel of Time Companion, which differs to the main books of the WoT in many points, overall strength in the One Power was only a measure of the sheer raw amount of the One Power that an individual could draw at once, which also determined whether or not that individual could create certain weaves. When two channelers compared their strength, this was the factor that was considered. The scale of strength in the One Power consisted of 72 base levels, with 72 being the lowest end of the range, and 1 being the highest. In addition, there were six more levels for men at the high end, ++6 to ++1.</p>
